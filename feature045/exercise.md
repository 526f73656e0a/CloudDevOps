# Exercise

Develop a Python 3 program

```sh
main.py
```

This program will be invoked by user 'root' using the
following procedure

```sh
cd feature045
python main.py
```

and should fulfill the task described below (cp. 'Task'). In case you
use non-standard Python modules it is also necessary to provide a file

```sh
requirements.txt
```

that lists these additionally needed Python modules. These modules will
be **automatically** installed through

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Git) stage, commit, and push your changes to feature
branch 'feature045'. Check, if the green check-mark appears in the
Gitea Web application at feature branch 'feature045'. If it appears,
submit a pull request via the Gitea Web application. If not, check your code.
It did not pass the tests.
